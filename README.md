  It was very difficult for me to place the picture in between the logo and the 'we're coming' div on mobile version. In the end I decided to use display: none for the right image when the desktop changes to mobile size. I also placed a div in between the logo and the 'we're coming' div and made the mobile image 1px and transparent when it was in desktop version and then with media queries I styled it as normal size and visible. <br><br>

## Overview
The challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
